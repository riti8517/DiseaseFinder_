Disease Finder Website 

Disease Finder is a machine learning-based web application designed to help users diagnose potential diseases based on their symptoms. The tool allows users to input symptoms, answer a series of relevant questions, and receive a predicted diagnosis, powered by a multi-classification AI model.

Key features of Disease Finder include:

Symptom Input: Users enter symptoms they are experiencing into the platform.
AI-Powered Diagnosis: The AI model, trained on a dataset from Kaggle, processes the symptoms and provides a probable diagnosis based on patterns learned from similar cases.
Interactive User Experience: The front-end, built using React, offers a smooth interface where users can easily interact with the system and receive real-time feedback on their symptoms.
Backend and Integration: The back-end, developed in Java using Spring Boot, manages communication between the front-end and the AI model server. It ensures efficient processing of user data and prediction results.

Disease Finder combines the fields of machine learning, data science, and healthcare to provide a user-friendly platform that can assist individuals in identifying possible illnesses, helping them make informed decisions about seeking medical attention.
